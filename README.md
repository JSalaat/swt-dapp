Group 42 Final Project for Binance 8 Weeks Africa Masterclass

Farming and Staking Project

The project is aimed primarily at solid waste minimization and control using a token as an incentive mechanism.
A greater part of Africa today is faced with the challenge of poor solid waste management. On the otherhand, the benefit of an efficient, sustainable 
and scalable approach cannot be overemphasized. A clean and habitable environment is key to our collective co-existence, hence the need for the project.

The target groups for this project are the regulated community, waste collectors, and recyclers. In mid 1980's and early 1990's a system of trade 
by barter was being used by waste collectors to incentivize waste generators. For example two plastic plates could exchange for 10 empty coca cola bottles. 
Today waste collectors and scavenger still go around searching for valuables sometimes setting electrical and electronic waste materials ablaze in an 
unsustainable environmental manner to recover precious metals like lead, silver, gold, mecury amongst others from used electrical and electronic waste. 
The recovered items are then sold to waste recyclers for little money. This entire process can be automated and managed in a way that will benefit all parties 
invloved and the environment as well. 

The idea will be implemented in phases, but for this particular project we will concentrate majorly on the token implementation using solidity as well as the 
distribution/Airdrop of the Solid Waste Control Token (SWT) using the staking and Farming contract. We will also design a simple and friendly user interface
using HTML, CSS and javascript to allow users to interact with the staking and farming contract. 

The SWT token will serve as the token to be mined which essentially will be used to incentivize waste generators and collectors.
The staked token will be an exchange token coinfpro (CFP) which is the selected exchange for SWT token distribtion.

The idea when completely implemented will provide an efficient approach in the handling of solid waste collection and recovery from source for the 
purpose of recycling. Both the environment and the waste generator will benefit from the process, the idea of waste to wealth would have been realised.
